## Motion Demos
### CNC Motion Demo: Corner View [video]

- If you speed up the video to 2X speed (or faster), you can really see how mechanically stable the system is. 
- The drag chain on the right-hand side (oriented to the camera) is suspended in air because the part of the table holding it was removed to finish a carpentry project (I was out of 2x4s).
- The jog speed is very close to the maximum stable speed. You can hear, at one point in the video, a nasty sound from the lead screws whipping hard during a traversal. This is occurring on the Y-axis.

## CNC Tooling Tests (aka cuts)
### My first cut [video]
The first cut ever made on the machine. Some very important things I discovered...
- Plywood has terrible machineability.
- Compression bits are not meant to plunge.
- An e-stop is very important!

Note: this is using the old spindle. It was a Huanyang 2.2kW water-cooled one. It ultimately failed due to design flaws. For instance, there were no o-rings separating the fluid from the electrical compartment. What happened over time is that the water would leak from the water-cooling jacket into the windings and electrical connections. It got so bad I had to drain the spindle after each use. Eventually, the inside of the spindle was so rusted that it (to this day) is stuck to the outer jacket in a semi-open position.**
